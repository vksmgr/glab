## project gDrive:
i have created this project for using google colab through pycharm IDE.

'' I'm Very much fan of pycharm ide. cause it provides very good features.
unfortunately it will not work with google colab.

as i wprk in data science domain i need good computation power. and google colab is the one which provide free HIGH computation power.
but you can't do modular programming in colab and execute it.

pycharm allows you to do modular programming, but if you don't have good computing resource this
will be very tough. so i decided to make small application which will integrate these two things.


this mdule allows you to write code in pycharm  and run it on google colab
